This tutorial is a simple step by step guide on how to use the Reach frontend to connect to an Algorand wallet and sign transactions using MyAlgoWallet and Algosigner with React.

Connecting to a wallet is one important requirements most DApp developers will have to integrate in their application when creating a DApp on the Algorand Blockchain.
This tutorial will guide you in connecting your DApp to an Algorand wallet using either My Algo Wallet or AlgoSigner. The tutorial and code solution is divided into two sections. My Algo Wallet Connect with Reach and Algosigner independent of Reach.

Connecting to My Algo Wallet is part of the inbuilt integration in reach which provides a fallback to connect to the wallet. AlgoSigner is not integrated in reach and so integrating AlgoSigner in your add does not require Reach.
